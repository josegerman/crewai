To understand the expression \( 2 * 9 + 4 - 2 * -2 / 4 \) and the resultant value of \( 22.5 \), we can break down the calculation into manageable parts, adhering to the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In our case, we will resolve the expression step-by-step:

1. **Start with Multiplication and Division:**
   
   The first step in solving the expression involves identifying and performing the multiplication and division operations:

   - First, we calculate \( 2 * 9 \):
     \[
     2 * 9 = 18
     \]
   - Next, we address the multiplication of \( -2 * -2 \):
     \[
     -2 * -2 = 4
     \]
   - Then, we perform the division \( -2 / 4 \):
     \[
     -2 / 4 = -0.5
     \]

2. **Substituting back into the expression:**
   
   Once we have our individual results, we can substitute these back into the original expression:
   \[
   18 + 4 - (-0.5)
   \]
   Here \( - (-0.5) \) is equivalent to adding \( 0.5 \). 

3. **Combining Results:**
   
   Now we can perform the addition and subtraction step:
   - First, add \( 18 + 4 \):
     \[
     18 + 4 = 22
     \]
   - Then add \( 22 + 0.5 \):
     \[
     22 + 0.5 = 22.5
     \]

4. **Final Result:**
   
   By following the order of operations and carefully performing each step, we arrive at the final result of the expression:
   \[
   2 * 9 + 4 - 2 * -2 / 4 = 22.5
   \]

In summary, the equation \( 2 * 9 + 4 - 2 * -2 / 4 \) simplifies down to a value of \( 22.5 \) after systematically applying the mathematical operations and carefully executing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the correct order. This demonstrates not only the importance of mathematical operations but also the beauty in how numbers interact to produce an outcome. The final answer thus reflects both the arithmetic processes involved and the logic underpinning the calculations.
