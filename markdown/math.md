To deeply understand how the given mathematical expression is evaluated, let's break down the process step by step and explain each stage in detail.

### Given Mathematical Expression:
\[ 2 * 4 * 10 / 2 \]

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **First Multiplication**:
   - The expression begins with \(2 * 4\).
   - Multiplication is performed from left to right.
   - Calculate \(2 * 4\):
     \[ 2 * 4 = 8 \]
   - So after the first multiplication, the expression simplifies to:
     \[ 8 * 10 / 2 \]

2. **Second Multiplication**:
   - Next, we need to multiply the result from the first step by 10.
   - Perform the operation \(8 * 10\):
     \[ 8 * 10 = 80 \]
   - Now the expression reduces to:
     \[ 80 / 2 \]

3. **Division**:
   - Finally, we need to divide the result from the second step by 2.
   - Perform the division \(80 / 2\):
     \[ 80 / 2 = 40 \]
   - We have now evaluated the entire expression.

### Result:
The result of the mathematical expression \(2 * 4 * 10 / 2\) is 40. 

When broken down, this calculation demonstrates the order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS/BODMAS (standing for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)). In this specific case, only multiplication and division are involved, and they are processed sequentially from left to right.

### Conclusion:
The detailed steps show the intermediate results at each stage, ensuring clarity and understanding of how the final result of 40.0 is obtained. This explanation provides a comprehensive view of the operation sequence and reinforces the importance of following the order of operations in mathematical expressions.
