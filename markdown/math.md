In evaluating the expression \(2 + 2 \times 10\), it is essential to adhere to the order of operations, commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). This structure ensures that mathematical expressions are interpreted consistently and accurately. 

Let's break down the equation step-by-step to illustrate how the final result of 22 was derived.

1. **Identify Components of the Expression**: The expression consists of two operations: addition and multiplication. In this case, we have \(2\) (the first operand), \(2\) (the second operand for addition), and \(10\) (the operand for multiplication).

2. **Apply the Order of Operations**: According to the order of operations, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. Thus, we first execute the multiplication before the addition.

3. **Execute the Multiplication**: We take the second operand, \(2\), and multiply it by \(10\):
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20
   \]
   This step gives us a new component of the expression, which simplifies our original formula to:
   \[
   2 + 20
   \]

4. **Perform the Addition**: Once the multiplication is complete, our next step is to conduct the addition. We add the result of the multiplication (20) to the first operand (2):
   \[
   2 + 20 = 22
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The final answer, therefore, is \(22\). This process illustrates how the order of operations is crucial in achieving the correct result, as performing addition before multiplication would have led to an erroneous conclusion.

Thus, the exploration of this seemingly simple mathematical expression not only highlights a foundational aspect of arithmetic but also emphasizes the importance of following established rules to arrive at a valid conclusion. The calculation, adhering strictly to the order of operations, leads us undeniably to the final result of \(22\).
